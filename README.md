lsusb command for Mac OS X
==========================

This is an utility to easily list USB devices in Mac OS X, just like the `lsusb` command in Linux. It leverages the data from the `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` built-in command available in Mac.

To install, clone the repository and copy to a location available in your PATH, for example `cp lsusb /usr/sbin`.
